This is a minimal Open Telemetry learning exercise. Troubleshooting distributed systems is something I'm interested in, so this project represents some baby steps in this direction.

I'm working through Dometrain.com's [course on Open Telemetry](https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-open-telemetry-in-dotnet/), but they don't give the source until the end, apparently, and the course example is more complicated than I want. So I'm trying it myself in parallel. But I've hit blockers already, see [issues](https://github.com/adamfoneil/OpenTelemetryDemo/issues).
